## Fun Facts About Me:

I grew up outside a small town in Norteast Missouri. I have enjoyed music since I was five years old. I can play the Alto, Tenor, and Baritone Saxophones as well as the 6 string Acoustic Guitar, 12 String Acoustic Guitar and the Electric Bass. I am a ***massive*** computer nerd who loves customization and diy, along with retro console games. I may ~~or may not~~ have a love/hate relationship with the game Rocket League.
